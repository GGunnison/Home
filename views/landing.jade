            | While this was the first year for me to take part, this was the 13th house build that my family has been a part of. During the first week
            | in August a team ranging from 25-60 travel down to La Mision, Mexico to build a house for a family that does not have one. This year our
            | team, which comes from Yorba Linda Friends Church, had the wonderful opportunity to build a home for the Heranandez family. A family of 6,
            | whom had almost nothing, had a house started and built for them over the course of 3 1/2 days, a life changing experience. Before going down,
            | I had always wanted to see the construction madness for myself, so I made a video so you could see it too. Take a look!

            | free world. My pride and joy. My favorite girl, sorry Jess. This thing is a piece of red white and blue Americana Machinery and is pumping 
            | 4.0 liters of uncensored raw fuel through her straight six nuclear power plant. This is a war wagon revival, my rebuild, 12 months running 
            | strong.

            | and Design, through an MIT program called MISTI. I took up the opportunity and spent 10 weeks in Singapore after my freshmen year at MIT. At
            | that point, I didn't know what I wanted to major in and study so while I was in Singapore I worked on several different projects one of which
            | was an iPhone Dock.

            | In high school I took two years of a Advanced Engineering, which concentrated on Vex Robotics Competitions. The first year I took the class,
            | the first year it was offered, I was on a team of 7 guys, we ultimately did not do well. The next year however, the class had more resources
            | and I was much more successful, placing in several competitions, winning one, and having the opportunity to go to the world competition. This 
            | class is where I decidedly found my love for Engineering and eventually went on to MIT when I was given the opportunity.
